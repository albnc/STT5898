This is a report generated by `knitr::spin()`.

Let's try some **knitr** options:

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1](figure/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)

Now write an inline value. We know the value of $\pi$ is
`3.1415927`
.

Finally please note that all roxygen comments are
optional. You do not need chunk options, either,
unless you want more control over the output
elements such as the size of plots.
